**This application has been designed for experimental purposes to develop a project for writing M. Sc. Thesis.<br />
In the process we will collect your GPS data and we will use these data anonymously.<br />**
<br />
## How to use:
*	Always have the internet connection and GPS on when using the app.
*	Open the application.
*	If it is first time you use the app touch “Agree and Continue” and give required permissions. Note: you should choose “always” or “all the time” for location service.
*	Move the map and put the green placeholder where you want to start your trip (where you are) then touch “set origin”
*	Move the map and put the purple placeholder where you want to go. Then touch “get direction”. You should now be able to see the direction.
*	Touch “start” when you started moving.
*	After you finished the path touch either “Finish – moved on path” or “Finish – violated path” based on your movement.
*	Process is Finished.<br />
## Please pay attention to the following instructions for using this application:<br />
*	In the first page, after clicking on the “Agree and Continue”, if nothing happens, you should go to your phone setting->apps and select the tracking app and give all the permission it requires.
*	Note that for location service permission you need to choose “all the time” so application can work in background
*	Note that the estimated time is not accurate since it does not consider traffic data. So, don’t count on it.
*	We mostly prefer the way which user travel on the specified direction. But, if in any case you didn’t move on the specified path, choose the “Finish – Violated path” option. Choose “Finish – moved on Path” in other case.
*	If you are having a long trip (for example about 1 hour or more) you may consider the battery usage of the application since it gathers GPS data frequently.
